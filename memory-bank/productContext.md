# Product Context

## Product Vision

**Name:** MessageAI  
**Tagline:** Real-Time Collaborative Messaging with AI Features  
**Target User:** Remote Team Professionals

---

## Core Problem

remote teams face several messaging challenges:
- **thread overwhelm:** long conversations are hard to catch up on
- **decision archaeology:** finding past decisions requires endless scrolling
- **priority overload:** important messages get buried in noise
- **action item loss:** tasks mentioned in chat fall through the cracks
- **coordination friction:** scheduling meetings takes 10+ messages

---

## Product Solution

### MVP: Production-Quality Messaging Infrastructure
build solid messaging foundation first, then add ai on top

**core messaging features:**
1. real-time one-on-one messaging
2. group chats (3+ participants)
3. offline support with automatic sync
4. read receipts (computed from lastSeenAt)
5. typing indicators (rtdb for performance)
6. online/offline presence
7. image sharing
8. push notifications

### AI Features Layer
intelligent features that solve remote team pain points

**ai capabilities:**
1. **thread summarization** - catch up in 30 seconds with 3 bullet points
2. **action item extraction** - automatic task tracking with owners
3. **priority detection** - urgent messages auto-flagged
4. **decision tracking** - log team decisions automatically
5. **proactive assistant** - detect scheduling needs and offer help

## Key Differentiators

### vs slack/teams
- **simpler:** focused on messaging, not feature bloat
- **smarter:** ai that actually helps (not just search)
- **mobile-first:** built for mobile from ground up

### vs whatsapp/telegram
- **team-oriented:** designed for work conversations
- **ai-powered:** automatic summarization and task tracking
- **decision logging:** never lose track of what was agreed

### vs notion/linear
- **real-time:** instant messaging, not async docs

## Design Principles

### 1. simplicity first
- clean, uncluttered interface
- core actions always one tap away
- no hidden features or complex navigation

### 2. offline-first
- app works without internet
- messages queue automatically
- no user intervention needed

### 3. performance obsession

- only proactive when high confidence

### 5. privacy-conscious
- clear data usage (stored in firebase)
- no tracking or analytics (beyond firebase)
- user controls their data
